I am excited to recommend Arjun Mukherjee for this opportunity. Although I was a member of Alpha Kappa Psi, our fraternities partnered frequently, and it was through these collaborations that I first met Arjun. His leadership in Delta Sigma Pi as Vice President of Finance and Professional Activities was immediately evident, and his ability to drive initiatives while fostering meaningful connections impressed me. Our professional paths crossed further when we worked on challenging projects, allowing me to see his analytical brilliance and collaborative approach in action. Over time, our shared experiences and mutual respect grew into a close friendship. Arjunâ€™s resourcefulness, dedication, and ability to excel in high-pressure environments make him a standout professional and a remarkable colleague. I am confident he would bring immense value to Citi.
