FR-6: Users shall be able to view detailed information about each book.
2.3 Shopping Cart
FR-7: Users shall be able to add books to their shopping cart.
FR-8: Users shall be able to view and edit the contents of their shopping cart.
FR-9: Users shall be able to proceed to checkout from their shopping cart.
2.4 Payment Processing
FR-10: The system shall integrate with a payment gateway to process payments.
FR-11: Users shall receive a confirmation email after successful payment.
2.5 Seller Functionality
FR-12: Sellers shall be able to list books for sale on the platform.
FR-13: Sellers shall be able to manage their listed books (edit, delete).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

3.1 Performance
NFR-1: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
NFR-2: Page load times should not exceed 3 seconds under normal operating conditions.
3.2 Security
NFR-3: All user data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
NFR-4: The system should implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for seller accounts.
3.3 Usability
NFR-5: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all ages.
NFR-6: The system should be accessible to users with disabilities in compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
3.4 Scalability
NFR-7: The system should be designed to scale horizontally to support additional users and data as the platform grows.
4. Technical Requirements

4.1 Platform
TR-1: The application shall be built using a modern web framework (e.g., React.js, Django).
TR-2: The backend shall use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
TR-3: The system shall be deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure).
