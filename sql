Here’s a list of 10 detailed questions you can ask in your meeting to better understand the project’s needs, ensure success, and cover important aspects:

1. **Objective Clarification**: What is the primary goal of the optimization? Are we focusing on cost reduction, efficiency, maximizing output, or minimizing a specific resource?
   
2. **Key Metrics for Success**: What key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics will define success for this project? How will we measure improvement or progress?

3. **Constraints and Limitations**: Are there any hard constraints we must consider (e.g., resource caps, regulatory limits, deadlines)? What flexibility do we have with these constraints?

4. **Data Scope and Integrity**: Is the gathered data comprehensive, or are there gaps we need to be aware of? How confident are we in the accuracy of the data, and are there known outliers or inconsistencies?

5. **Modeling Preferences**: Are there specific optimization methods or models (e.g., linear programming, machine learning, heuristic algorithms) that we should prioritize based on past success or familiarity?

6. **Scalability Considerations**: Will the optimization solution need to scale for larger datasets or extended use cases in the future? How important is scalability versus immediate applicability?

7. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Who are the key stakeholders, and how involved will they be in reviewing and approving the analysis and models? What are their expectations regarding outcomes?

8. **Risk and Sensitivity**: Are there areas of the project that carry significant risk if the model predictions or optimizations are off? What sensitivity analyses do we need to perform to ensure robustness?

9. **Time Frame and Milestones**: What is the timeline for completing the analysis and delivering the models? Are there any critical milestones or checkpoints we need to meet along the way?

10. **Post-Implementation Expectations**: Once the optimization is complete, what kind of post-analysis or monitoring will be required to ensure the solution continues to perform as expected?

These questions should help you gain a deeper understanding of the project's requirements and create a solid foundation for the analysis and modeling phase.
