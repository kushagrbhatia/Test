Dear [Company Name],

I'm writing to request an appeal for my tuition reimbursement. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete [course/class name] due to an unforeseen emergency. A close friend of mine sustained a severe hand injury and was admitted to the ER. Following his discharge, he needed assistance with daily tasks while his hand recovered. With no one else available to help, I had to take care of him for the next week.

This unexpected situation required my full attention, preventing me from dedicating time to my coursework. I understand the importance of the reimbursement policy, but I hope you can consider this emergency.

Iâ€™m happy to provide documentation of my friend's ER visit if needed. Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your consideration of my appeal.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
