Dear [Tuition Reimbursement Company Name],

I am writing to formally request an appeal for the tuition reimbursement for [course/class name]. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to complete the course as planned. I would like to explain the situation that led to my inability to fulfill the course requirements.

A very close friend of mine experienced a severe hand injury and was admitted to the emergency room for urgent care. As a result of this incident, he required assistance for his basic daily activities during his recovery period. Given the severity of his injury and the fact that he had no one else to rely on for support, I took on the responsibility of caring for him throughout the week following his ER visit. This unexpected situation demanded a significant portion of my time and energy, leaving me unable to dedicate the necessary attention to my coursework.

I understand the importance of the tuition reimbursement policy and the criteria that must be met to qualify for it. However, this was an unforeseen emergency, and my friend's condition required immediate and ongoing care. I hope you can understand the circumstances that led to my request for an appeal.

I kindly ask for your consideration in this matter. I am more than willing to provide any additional documentation or information that may be required, such as a medical note from the ER visit, to support my request. Your understanding and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my appeal. I hope for a favorable response and am happy to discuss this further if needed.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
